## Made In Japan. Akio Morita and SONY // In progress 72%

by Akio Morita, Edwin M.Reingold and Mitsuko Shimomura

### My general thoughts on the book // Review
*Write your thoughts here*


### Part I: War - Survival and hope

> *"All the money in the world in the world cannot give a person education unless that person is willing to sit down by himself and study hard. But money can provide one kind of education, the education you can get by travel." ~Kyuzaemon Morita (Akio's Dad)*

- Akio came actually from a rich family. He used to live in a mansion house-with a tennis court- while living with his brothers and sisters, aunt and uncle, 6 servants and some kids that the family was helping to attend school in exchange for work in the factory. Apparently they were livin opposite the Toyoda family. 

* Akioâ€™s dad, Kyuzaemon, took Akio at the age of 11 to the factory to see the brewing process of Sake, and to attend meetings. Akio liked this, and he thanks his father for this.

* Japanese were not allowed to look at the Emperor. If His Majesty would pass with His car, Japanese would have to turn their face away. 
* First time Japanese heard their Emperor was in a public announcement made by him to signal the end of the war.


### Part II: Peace -Our new life beggins

* Apparently many of the early chances SONY had were based on the friendships help by Ibuka. Both in Japan, where they wanted to team up with local schools and aquire the patent for the AC Bias method, and in the US which set up an interview between Morita and Bell Labs to lease the patent of the transistor.

* While Morita was in Dusseldorf he realised that Germany that was even more hard time after the war was recovering way faster. In my opinion this was because:
i) European countries embraced Germany, amended the tragedies they caused and offer the country help.
ii) The Establishment of the EEA(European Economic Area) was crucial for the trade at the time.
Japan had no allies and no trade whatsoever at that time.

* Kyuzaemon Morita, Supported fully his son while he excepected him to take over the company he let Akio go fullfuill his dream. 

* Their first bulky tape recorder had no Marketing story and couldnt sell at all. It was later that Morita had an idea for selling it to the schools.


### Part III: Selling to the world- My learning curve


* Ibuka moto??
* Some of the innovations of Sony was one of the most famous storage devices in the world in the 80s-00s the 3.5mm floppy disk.
* The ex head of the Mitsui bank Mandai-san joined Sony. When they reached out a couple of months later to Mitsui bank for loans(50s), Mandai-san in a orderly manner told the accountants and executives to buy Sony's stock. Morita was impressed that he actually ordered his ex subordinated to buy Sony stocks.Many of them were made millionnaires as they listened to Mandai-san's order.
* The Walkman was Morita's idea. He had a difficult time pitching the idea and nobody thouht it would become a succesfull product. History prooved otherwise.
* Morita wanted his kids to take the best education posible. That's why he enrolled them to the best schoolds abroad ion both New York and England. He was concerned that leftish teachers were doin a bad job teaching subjects like History.
* Morita always recalls his military training as one of the most difficult things he did strength wise. He mentions that difficult situations in life make people stronger as army made him stronger as well. He enrolled his 2 boys Hideo and Masao to boy's camps were they hard a really hard time in the beggining but the grew stronger and managed to overcome the difficult situations.
* Morita was always seing coutries as companies. He spoke of Britain Inc. and France Inc. Contradicting stories: When he was establishing a new Sony branch in the UK everything rolled smoothly and fast; even Prince Charles visited the plant on the oppening day and later the Queen herself. In contrast, establishin a French Sony branch prooved difficult and beaurocratic because of goverental politics.

### Part IV: On Management -  Its all in the family
* Morita always wanted to have a sense of family amonst his employees. He would visit random Sony shops arround the world and talk to the salesperson and managers. This is a great way to establish the sense of family in a big organization.
### Part V: American and Japanese styles - The difference

* In contrast to how Americans were building their offices Morita beleives that when a new department is formed all employs, from mere engineers to executives must share the same open space floor. This is to have a sense of all employees sharing the same struggle.
* Sony introduced the blue jackets back in the 40s for every single employee. This was because after the war clothes were expensive and sold in black market. Sony had the money to buy these types of cloths to help its people. When the relations with the People's Republic of China were reestablished in the 70s and the news of Chinese workers wearing the Mao's blue uniform arrived jokes started spreading that a typical Sony's meeting looks like a Chinese factory. Morita colaborated with a top-tier Japanese fashion designer to design the new jackets.
