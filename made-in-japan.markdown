## Made In Japan. Akio Morita and SONY // Completed

by Akio Morita, Edwin M.Reingold and Mitsuko Shimomura

### My general thoughts on the book // Review
How can a book from 1987 have so many similarities about the current economic situation and today's world?
Written by SONY's co-founder Akio Morita, this memoir describes the fall of an empire after its defeat in the WWII to its rise to be the second most powerfull country in the world at that time(3rd today behind China). With a solid focus only on Inovation, Sony invented and pioneered, from creation the 3.5mm floppy disk, the colour TV, the Walkman, the CD and Bluray to the Playstation. 

This book though gives a glimpse of the 60s-80s world through the eyes of a Japanese businessman; and as reluctant as I was to read the book as I considered it old fashion and outdated the leadership lessons,the history and the culture information makes this book more relevant than ever. Morita as an inovative person as he was tired to solve real life problems and come up with easy solutions to the new life's needs. When he wanted to listen to his music on the road, he invented the walkman, better TV picture? he invented the HDTV back in the 80s, GPS navigation system in cars , on demand tv programs and more. He was fond of the new computer era yet to commence and he talked in favor of a global information bank that could be accessed by anyone with a computer.

One of the greatest remarks of this book is the US-Japanese and EU-Japanese rivary. As Japan's economy was rising the US and EU imposed huge tarrifs in their products and did everything they could to try and stop Japan from selling their products and bringing their business overseas. Although this didn't stop Japan from expanding and conquering the world it is obvious that the same thing is happening today in the US-Chinese front.

Throuout his career at SONY, Morita placed every employee in the epicenter of the company giving them freedom to create and innovate, express their ideas and problems. His culture was for upper management and emploees to be indistinguishable and everybody to feel like a family. He was one of the first to introduce the flat office structure where emploees and managers share the same area in the room.


### Part I: War - Survival and hope

> *"All the money in the world in the world cannot give a person education unless that person is willing to sit down by himself and study hard. But money can provide one kind of education, the education you can get by travel." ~Kyuzaemon Morita (Akio's Dad)*

- Akio came actually from a rich family. He used to live in a mansion house-with a tennis court- while living with his brothers and sisters, aunt and uncle, 6 servants and some kids that the family was helping to attend school in exchange for work in the factory. Apparently they were living opposite the Toyoda family. 

* Akioâ€™s dad, Kyuzaemon, took Akio at the age of 11 to the factory to see the brewing process of Sake, and to attend meetings. Akio liked this, and he thanks his father for this.

* Japanese were not allowed to look at the Emperor. If His Majesty would pass with His car, Japanese would have to turn their face away. 
* First time Japanese heard their Emperor was in a public announcement made by him to signal the end of the war.


### Part II: Peace -Our new life begins

* Apparently many of the early chances SONY had were based on the friendships help by Ibuka. Both in Japan, where they wanted to team up with local schools and acquire the patent for the AC Bias method, and in the US which set up an interview between Morita and Bell Labs to lease the patent of the transistor.

* While Morita was in Dusseldorf he realised that Germany that was even more hard time after the war was recovering way faster. In my opinion this was because:
i) European countries embraced Germany, amended the tragedies they caused and offer the country help.
ii) The Establishment of the EEA(European Economic Area) was crucial for the trade at the time.
Japan had no allies and no trade whatsoever at that time.

* Kyuzaemon Morita, Supported fully his son while he excepted him to take over the company he let Akio go fulfil his dream. 

* Their first bulky tape recorder had no Marketing story and couldn't sell at all. It was later that Morita had an idea for selling it to the schools.


### Part III: Selling to the world- My learning curve

* Some of the innovations of Sony was one of the most famous storage devices in the world in the 80s-00s the 3.5mm floppy disk.
* The ex head of the Mitsui bank Mandai-san joined Sony. When they reached out a couple of months later  to Mitsui bank for loans(50s), Mandai-san in an orderly manner told the accountants and executives to buy Sony's stock. Morita was impressed that he actually ordered his ex subordinated to buy Sony stocks.Many of them were made millionaires as they listened to Mandai-san's order.
* The Walkman was Morita's idea. He had a difficult time pitching the idea and nobody thought it would become a successful product. History proved otherwise.
* Morita wanted his kids to take the best education possible. That's why he enrolled them to the best schools abroad ion both New York and England. He was concerned that leftish teachers were doin a bad job teaching subjects like History.
* Morita always recalls his military training as one of the most difficult things he did strength wise. He mentions that difficult situations in life make people stronger as army made him stronger as well. He enrolled his 2 boys Hideo and Masao to boy's camps were they hard a really hard time in the beginning but the grew stronger and managed to overcome the difficult situations.
* Morita was always seeing coutries as companies. He spoke of Britain Inc. and France Inc. Contradicting stories: When he was establishing a new Sony branch in the UK everything rolled smoothly and fast; even Prince Charles visited the plant on the oppening day and later the Queen herself. In contrast, establishin a French Sony branch prooved difficult and beaurocratic because of goverental politics.

### Part IV: On Management -  Its all in the family
* Morita always wanted to have a sense of family amonst his employees. He would visit random Sony shops arround the world and talk to the salesperson and managers. This is a great way to establish the sense of family in a big organization.
### Part V: American and Japanese styles - The difference

* In contrast to how Americans were building their offices Morita beleives that when a new department is formed all employs, from mere engineers to executives must share the same open space floor. This is to have a sense of all employees sharing the same struggle.
* Sony introduced the blue jackets back in the 40s for every single employee. This was because after the war clothes were expensive and sold in black market. Sony had the money to buy these types of cloths to help its people. When the relations with the People's Republic of China were reestablished in the 70s and the news of Chinese workers wearing the Mao's blue uniform arrived jokes started spreading that a typical Sony's meeting looks like a Chinese factory. Morita colaborated with a top-tier Japanese fashion designer to design the new jackets.

### Part VI: Competition - The fuel of Japanese Enterprise
* Morita 

### Part VII: Technology - Survival Excersice 

* Morita during his visit to China he reviewed many Chinese factories and saw a lot of slow progress in what its meant to be the Chinese modernization
* During his visit to the Soviet Union and Moscow he also observed how bad were the proceeses in Russia. He realised that people dont care about their work, and they just want to make their quota at the end of the month. The then minister, of techonology and telecomunications during his meeting with Morita and the Russian bureaucrats asked Morita to make Sony outsource their product manufancuring in the Soviet Union. This was something that Morita didn't want to let happen. He was remarkably honest (at least for a Japanese) and he explained to him the truth that he was seing. The minister, though not happy about it he presented a small TV so as to amaze Morita by the Soviet Superiority. Morita again was not impressed and told the truth to the Soviet minister.
