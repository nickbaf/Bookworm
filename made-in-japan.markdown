### My general thoughts on the book // Review
*Write your thoughts here*


### Section 1: The Five Principles of Ultimate Influence

* Ultimate Influence encompasses not only the ability to move someone to action but the manner in which you move them.
* Moving a person by force is not sustainable: Once the person loses his positional authority, his ability to force others to action is gone.
* All actions we as human beings take are based on self-interest, based on our personal value system.
* All things being equal, people do business with, refer business to, and allow themselves to be influenced by those people they know, like, and trust.
* To elicit like and trust, give someone else a personal benefit for taking action.

#### Chapter 1: The Five Principles

* Only when we are in control of our emotions are we able to act out of thought, out of consciousness, and create a winning situation for everyone.
* Feelings are self-justifying, with a set of perceptions and proofs all their own; this is when we rationalize.
* Each of us sees the world in a unique way based on upbringing, environment, schooling, popular media, and the people with whom we associate.
* Such different belief systems leads to non-understanding, which in turn leads to misunderstanding.
* The ego is nothing more than one's sense of self. It is the driving force in everything people do, and it is highly sensitive.
* Being able to move a person to your side of an issue comes down to how you make him feel about himself.
* A frame is the premise or context from which everything else in your interpersonal transactions takes place.
* Set the frame in every interpersonal conflict; otherwise you allow the other person to, and it won't serve you well.
* Tact is the ability to say something in a way that makes the other person feel less threatened or defensive and more open to your ideas.
* Empathy is related to tact but can be defined as the ability to identify with another person's feelings.
